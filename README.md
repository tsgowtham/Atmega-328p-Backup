# Atmega-328p-Backup
Thsi repo contains a backup of a working Atmega 328p's EEPROM, Efuse, Hfuse,Lfuse and Flash memory in bin files.
These files can be flashed on a bricked Atmega using avrdude as long as it's lfuse is set in a way that it can't use an external clock.
There are also 2 examples given in the repo which are written in C. These can be used to test the AVR.
